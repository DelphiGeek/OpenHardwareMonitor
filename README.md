OpenHardwareMonitor
===================

Tim Koers his version of Open Hardware Monitor.

The original project can be found at openhardwaremonitor.org

Since the creater of Open Hardware Monitor has not updated OHM since 2012, I wanted to implement new stuff and improve existing stuff.
Sander Teunissen is currently creating a new internal website for the HTTP server.
Later on I am going to redesign OHM fully, including multi language support. The development of all those goodies may take a while.
